# ECE650 : Final Project

Replace FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, WATIAM, and STUDENT_ID, EMAIL in
`user.yml` by your first and last name, WatIAM id, student number, and
email, respectively. The information must be entered for all members
of your team. Whenever possible, please use ASCII characters.

Do not change the format `user.yml`. We will parse it
automatically. Only enter the information requested.

The main executable file for your solution to the assignment should be
`ece650-prj`.

Do not include MiniSat in your repository. We will clone it in your
repository using the command. This is exactly the same as was done in
Assignment 4.

```
git clone https://git.uwaterloo.ca/ece650-f23/minisat.git
```

Note that for the project you have to create a `CMakeLists.txt` on
your own. You can use examples from previous assignments or from
course examples on Gitlab.

Do not forget to include your report in `report.pdf`

Commit your changes and submit on GitLab.
